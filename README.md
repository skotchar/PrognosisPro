Prognosis Pro 💻🧬📈
====================

Welcome to Prognosis Pro, a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on genetic markers, lifestyle factors, and environmental variables. This model can aid in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare, potentially saving lives and improving health outcomes.

Features 🚀
-----------

-   Analyze a large and diverse dataset to identify the most important features for predicting disease risk
-   Use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks to make accurate predictions
-   Evaluate model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score
-   Deploy the model in a web application or mobile app for personalized disease risk predictions

Installation 🛠️
----------------

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  Run the `prognosis_pro.py` script to train and evaluate the model.

Usage 📊
--------

To use Prognosis Pro, simply input your own data (genetic markers, lifestyle factors, and environmental variables) into the web application or mobile app. The model will then generate personalized disease risk predictions based on your input.
